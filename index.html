  <p> Of all the hosting sites we've used so far the one I found to be the most useful is the m-drive/vdrive. The main reason I like this
  hosting site the most is because of how easy it is to use. For example, If I am doing my work at school I do not have to worry about 
  connecting to an outside source. At school I can simply manage all of my files directly from pc. Additionally, even at home this
  platform is still just as effective. Simply logging into my SVSU account from the wepage, which I have open most of the time anyways, 
  doesn't create any hassel when it comes to managing files. Of the platforms we've used so far I would have to pick the m-drive/vdrive for
  its ease of use.</p>
