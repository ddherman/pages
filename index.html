    <p> Of all the hosting sites we've used so far the one I found to be the most useful is the m-drive/vdrive. The main reason I like this
    hosting site the most is because of how easy it is to use. For example, If I am doing my work at school I do not have to worry about 
    connecting to an outside source. At school I can simply manage all of my files directly from pc. Additionally, even at home this
    platform is still just as effective. Simply logging into my SVSU account from the wepage, which I have open most of the time anyways, 
    doesn't create any hassel when it comes to managing files. Of the platforms we've used so far I would have to pick the m-drive/vdrive for
    its ease of use.</p>

    <p>For program 3 I chose my github pages as my hosting service. I chose github because we are begining to use it
    at my work and I would like to get more accustom with it. Even though this application is slightly different from my use 
    at work I would like to "git" proficent with using the service.</p>
